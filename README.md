# Facial Emotion Recognition & Crowd Counting  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **Facial Emotion Recognition** and **Crowd Counting** using **Deep Learning** models.  
- **Facial Emotion Recognition**: Classifies emotions from facial images (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry).  
- **Crowd Counting**: Estimates the number of people in an image using density estimation techniques.  

## 📂 Datasets  
We used two datasets for this project:  
1. **[FER2013 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)** – A widely used dataset for facial emotion recognition.  
2. **UIT Crowd Counting Dataset** – Contains images annotated with crowd density information.  

## 🏗️ Model Architectures  
### **Facial Emotion Recognition Models**  
✅ **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** – Achieved **92% accuracy**  
✅ **MobileNetV2** – Lightweight, high-speed model  
✅ **VGG16** – Pretrained on ImageNet, good feature extraction  
✅ **ResNet50V2** – Deep architecture for improved accuracy  

### **Crowd Counting Model**  
✅ **Multi-Column CNN (MCNN)** – Trained with various hyperparameter optimizations  
✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used **Grid Search** & **Random Search** to enhance accuracy
